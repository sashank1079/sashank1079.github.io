        <p>Hi, I’m Sashank Machiraju—a tech enthusiast with a passion for problem-solving, storytelling, and sports. By day, I design data workflows, develop AI tools, and fine-tune cloud systems. By night, I’m hitting three-pointers on the basketball court, curating playlists, or diving into a gripping crime novel.</p>
        
        <p>My journey spans crafting intuitive chatbots, building data systems that bring insights to life, and exploring diverse learning environments—from Dubai’s dynamic tech hub to Northeastern University’s classrooms. Each step has sharpened my skills and broadened my perspective.</p>
        
        <p>Much like basketball, my approach is thoughtful and goal-oriented—whether tackling code challenges or debating the best thriller. I thrive on collaboration, creativity, and curiosity.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s connect to build something meaningful, spark new ideas, or simply share great music and stories!</p>
